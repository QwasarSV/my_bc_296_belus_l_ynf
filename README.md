# Welcome to My Bc
***

## Task

To reproduce a basic calculator with the following specs : 

- must only contain the operators +, -, *, /, and modulo (percent)
- must only have integer values
- can contain parentheses, but each group must be properly closed
- can contain spaces

Divisions are euclidian keeping only the quotient, while the remainder can be obtained with a modulo operation.


## Description
Parsing the result using a shunting yard algorithm and change infix notation into Reverse Polish Notation.
then using simple and easy algo to perform the operation following the RPN notation.

## Installation

type ``make`` or ``make my_bc`` inside the terminal to compile 
type ``make fclean`` inside the terminal clean the binaries; 

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
Format is :
```
 ./my_bc "(a+b)*c"
```
Test the ruby gem.

Type in terminal :
```
cd rb/my_gem_box/my_basic_calc/
rake
```
